## Task 1 : Process and summarize your data

### 1.1 : Research questions

1) How does the area of a cancer affects the diagnosis?

2) How strongly do smoothness and compactness correlate, and is it dependent on diagnosis?

3) What is the variable in this dataset that is the best indicator of a malignant cancer?

4) Is it harder to perform radius measurements on malignant cancers compared to benign cancers? That is, is the standard error in radius measurements bigger for malignant cancers?

### 1.2 : Summarizing and Graphing 

#### Research question 1

We compute the summary statistics of the area of a cancer :
```{r}
summary(cancer_sample$area_mean)
```
